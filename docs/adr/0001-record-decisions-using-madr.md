# ADR-0001: Record decisions using MADR
## Context and problem statement
We want significant decisions, and the reasoning behind them, to be easy to find from inside the repository and to survive changes in team and codebase. We need to choose a single format and structure so records stay consistent and tooling can read them.

## Decision drivers
- Records should live next to the code and version with it.
- Format should be lean enough that writing one is not a chore (Best Simple System for Now: the lightest format that does the job).
- Format should be widely understood and tool-supported.

## Considered options
- MADR (Markdown Any/Architectural Decision Records)
- Michael Nygard's original template
- Y-statements (Sustainable Architectural Decisions)
- A formless or freeform convention
- An external wiki, no in-repo records

## Decision outcome
Chosen option: MADR (Markdown Any/Architectural Decision Records), kept in `docs/adr/` as a single global numbered sequence. Using the template at `docs/adr/0000-adr-template.md`, which is MADR 4.0 extended with two Polylith-specific fields, `affects` and `interface-impact`. ADRs are immutable; reversing a decision means writing a new ADR that supersedes the old.

MADR over the alternatives because it is lean, plain Markdown (version-control and review friendly), captures options and consequences explicitly, and has existing tooling. Nygard's template is leaner but omits the options/consequences structure we want. Y-statements are terser still and harder to extend. An external wiki breaks the "context lives with the code" goal.

### Consequences
- Good: one greppable decision log, consistent structure, tool compatible.
- Bad: requires the discipline to write a record when a decision is made.
- Neutral: numbering is global across the workspace, not per brick.

### Confirmation
`docs/adr/` exists and new significant decisions land here in the same pull request that implements them. `scripts/checks/lint.py` checks front matter, status values, sequential numbering, and that brick names in `affects` exist, enforced in pre-commit and CI.
