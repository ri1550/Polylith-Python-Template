# ADR-NNNN: Short title of the decision
## Context and problem statement
What is the situation, and what problem or requirement forces a decision now? Two to four sentences. State the architecturally significant requirement plainly.

## Decision drivers
- Driver 1 (e.g. must stay deployable as independent projects)
- Driver 2 (e.g. minimize coupling between components)
- Driver 3

## Considered options
- Option A
- Option B
- Option C

## Decision outcome
Chosen option: "Option X", because ...

State the decision in one or two sentences first, then the justification.

### Consequences
- Good: ...
- Bad: ...
- Neutral: ...

### Confirmation
How do we verify the decision is upheld over time? Prefer automated checks. Examples: `poly check` passes, `poly deps` shows no forbidden imports, a test asserts the rule, CI fails on violation.

## Interface notes
Fill this in only when `interface-impact` is `new` or `breaking`. Describe the public contract being added or changed: which brick's `__init__.py`, the signatures or names exposed, and what consumers must do to adapt. For a breaking change, note the migration path and which projects need updating.
